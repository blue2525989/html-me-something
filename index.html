	  <h1>Programming</h1>
    <p class="content">
          When it comes to my hobbies, programming is at the top of the list. For the last seven months I have coded
      everyday. It started off because I moved an hour away and needed to find a suitable preschool for my daughter and
      I could not find a database on the internet of school information and statistics, so I decided to make one myself.
       My family and I went to half price books and I bought three books on Java for under ten dollars and have been
          hooked since.

	  <h1>Motorcycles</h1>
    <p class="content">
    Weather permitting I enjoy riding my motorcycle. I own a 2001 Suzuki Katana 750. It looks like one of the fast
    sporty bikes, and it is, but I drive more casually. I enjoy riding on rural country back roads by my house where
     there is rarely another car. The most dangerous thing about riding motorcycles are other drivers on the road. My
    girl friend and I enjoy going for a short cruise on the weekends.

        <h1>Farming</h1>
    <p class="content">
        One of my favorite summer activities is farming. My family and I have about a 400 square foot organic vegetable
        garden. Each year we plant a lot of peas, green beans, carrots, lettuces, kale, and various other veggies. It is
        great for my six year old daughter. She enjoys going out and picking fresh peas and green beans straight from the
        plant to her mouth. I never have to make her eat her veggies, if anything I have to tell her to slow down and let
        the plants grow a little. Also it teaches her the importance of being conscious of nature.

    <p class="content">
        Also we have three goats. Totes ma goats, which is at the bottom of the page, is a Nigerian Dwarf goat. Buddy which
        is at the top of the page is half Nigerian dwarf and half fainting goat. Last we have a goat named Rosemary whom
        is a fainting goat. She is the mother of buddy. Also she is quite comical when she faints and either stops in
        her tracks and locks up, or tips over and makes weird noises for about ten seconds then gets back to playing.

	  <h1>Hiking</h1>
    <p class="content">
        When it is nice out my family and I enjoy hiking. The picture above is of the highest waterfall in Missouri. It is
        located on 'Taum Sauk mountain' about two hours south of St. Louis. Not only is it the tallest waterfall in the
        state, the mountain itself is the highest peak in the state. Time permitting you can visit the tallest waterfall
        and highest peak in Missouri in one afternoon. Just be prepared for the hike to the waterfall, the trail is rough at
    best.
